## Steps and Changes Explained

[Watch this Quick Take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYRGmilJOrM) to learn about how to create components dynamically, the best practices to follow, and a few caveats.

## How to start?

Start simple by running `yarn watch` (or `npm run watch`, if you set up the project with `npm`). This will start the project with a local development server.

The source files are located in the [`src`](./src) folder. All web components are within the [`src/modules`](./src/modules) folder. The folder hierarchy also represents the naming structure of the web components.
